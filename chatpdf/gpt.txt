i want to delete a file from the database in django

urls.py:
path('delete_vector/<int:file_id>/', views.delete_vector_db, name='delete_vector_db'),

views.py:
the page that show all files:

def docs(request):
    files_objects= UploadedFile.objects.all()

    return render(request, "docs.html", {'files_objects':files_objects}) 


the delete view:

@login_required
def delete_vector_db(request, file_id):
    try:
        uploaded_file = UploadedFile.objects.get(id=file_id, user=request.user)

        uploaded_file.delete()

        messages.success(request, 'file deleted successfully!', extra_tags='safe')

    except UploadedFile.DoesNotExist:
        messages.error(request, 'File not found!', extra_tags='safe')

    return redirect('docs')     


the template just the button url that delete the file:
docs.html:

{% for obj in files_objects %}
    <a class="dropdown-item" 
       href="{% url 'delete_vector_db' obj.id %}">
        <p>{{obj.id}}</p>
{% endfor %}    



the propleme is that when i delete a file its delete the last file that i add, niot the specifice file.
